# Real Time Object Detection with Tensorflow and OpenCV
In this project we collect and label images and use them to train a Tensorflow CNN (convolutional neural network) model to recognize relevant areas of (typeface) text in any image, video frame or frame from webcam video. You will learn how to extract image segments that your detector has identified as containing text and enhance them using various image filters from the OpenCV module. Then you will learn how to pass the result image to Google's open-source OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software using the pytesseract python library and read the text to whatever form of output you like. 

# Overview of Project
Train Tensorflow to recognize a Region of Interest (ROI) in an image or frame of a video.

Extract and enhance relevant image segments with OpenCV .

Use Tesseract to extract, export text data for use in real-time.

I have used the IDLE development environment to write a single script to scan our video, webcam input, or array of images for text and read that text into our output. 

# Installation requirements:
Tensorflow, the Tensorflow Object Detection API, Tesseract, the pytesseract library, labelImg for image annotation, OpenCV, and all other required software 

# Implementation Workflow
Set up a new Real Time Text Detection script
